# Array Modifier Console App Using C

## Description

**The Array Modifier Console App** is a modular C project, which involves manipulate and analyze arrays that dynamically
allocated on the heap and additionally scaling the performance of each manipulation. Users can interact with the program
through a
terminal, where they can perform various operations like displaying, searching, sorting, appending, and
performing basic statistical analyzes on arrays.

## What is Used

* **C Language:** Functionality and manipulations.
* **CMake:** Cross-platform build automation.
* **Git:** Version control and collaboration.

## How to Build and Run

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/array-modifier-app.git
   cd array-modifier-app
   ```

2. Create and go to Build directory:
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

3. Run CMake to configure project:
   ```
   cmake ..
   ```

4. Build the Project:
   ```
   cmake --build .
   ```

5. Run the executable manually: After the build is completed, navigate to the build directory and run the executable
   directly. Executable file could be directly inside of build directory (like in CLion's CMake) or inside of Debug
   folder. For example:
   ```
   .\build\Debug\array_modifier_app.exe
   ```

## Addable Features

* Expand functionality with more advanced Algorithms
* Supporting for file-based input and output
* Adding unit tests for core functions
